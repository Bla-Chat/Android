## Troubleshooting

I cannot install the app! You may need to allow apps from unknown sources in the options of your phone.

The app does not do xyz! Update the app and try it again, if it still does not work, write a detailed description what you did (starting with how you opened the app and every touch since then) and submit it as an issue. Screenshots help a lot.
